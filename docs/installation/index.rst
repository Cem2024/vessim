============
Installation
============

You can install our `latest release <https://pypi.org/project/vessim/>`_ via
`pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/>`_:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install vessim

If you require software-in-the-loop (SiL) capabilities, you can install the
`sil`` extra:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install vessim[sil]

For complex scenarios that involve custom co-simulation actors we recommend
cloning and editing this depository directly:

.. code-block:: console 
    
    pip install .
