To ease your start with Vessim, we provide two examples:

### cosim_example

The [cosim_example](https://github.com/dos-group/vessim/blob/main/examples/cosim_example.py) runs a fully simulated example scenario over the course of two days.
See `cosim_example` for more details.

### sil_example

The [sil_example](https://github.com/dos-group/vessim/blob/main/examples/sil_example.py) is a co-simulation example with software-in-the-loop. 
This scenario builds on cosim_example.py but connects to a real computing system through software-in-the-loop integration. This example is experimental and documentation is still in progress.
See `sil_example` for more details.
