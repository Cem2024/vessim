Software-in-the-loop
--------------------
The `sil_example <https://github.com/dos-group/vessim/blob/main/examples/sil_example.py>`_ is a co-simulation example with software-in-the-loop. 
This scenario builds on cosim_example.py but connects to a real computing system through software-in-the-loop integration. This example is experimental and documentation is still in progress.
